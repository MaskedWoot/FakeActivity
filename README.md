# FakeActivity
I made this script to allow myself some extra time to do off-screen work while still appearing active on-screen. 

When script is ran in PowerShell or PowerShell IDE (prefered) it will open Notepad.exe and place a '# ' within the document every 60 secs. The keypress mimic will keep the system active and show user active with IM titles like Skype for Business and MS Teams while also keeping GP set screensavers and power settings from taking effect. 

This script will allow the user the walk away from system or use another without need to worry about timeout on affected system.

You can easily change the time lapse, text editor and symbol that is used.
